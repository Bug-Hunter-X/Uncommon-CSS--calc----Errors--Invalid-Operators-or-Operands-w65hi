# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors: Invalid Operators or Operands

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The error arises from using invalid operators or operands within the `calc()` expression.  The browser will simply ignore the rule and apply no styling, potentially causing unexpected layout issues.

## Bug

The `bug.css` file contains CSS with an invalid `calc()` expression.  The code attempts to perform an invalid calculation, which causes the browser to ignore the style rule related to the `width` property.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates the corrected CSS. The invalid `calc()` expression is replaced with a valid one, ensuring that the calculation is performed correctly and the style is applied as intended.
