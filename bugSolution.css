The solution involves carefully reviewing the `calc()` expression for any typos, incompatible units (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages directly), or incorrect operator usage. Always double-check the order of operations if you have multiple operators in your `calc()` expression.  Ensure you are using valid CSS units (e.g., px, em, rem, %, etc.) and operators (+, -, *, /).

Here's an example of a corrected `calc()` expression:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```
This calculation subtracts 20 pixels from 100% of the container's width.  Each component is correctly formatted and the units are compatible.
