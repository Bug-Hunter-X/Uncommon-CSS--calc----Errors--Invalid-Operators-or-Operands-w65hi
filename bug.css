The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using it. One such error is using invalid operators or operands within the expression. For example, using an unexpected character or attempting to perform an operation on incompatible data types will result in an error. The CSS will be ignored by the browser and might cause unexpected layout issues.
